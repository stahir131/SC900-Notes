There are four learning paths to prepare for the SC-900<br />

**Part 1: Describe the concepts of security, compliance, and identity**<br />
**Part 2: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft Entra<br />**
**Part 3: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft security solutions<br />**
**Part 4: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft compliance solutions<br />**


**Part 1: Describe the concepts of security, compliance, and identity**<br />
Covered in this chapter are;<br />
1. Shared responsibilty and defence in-depth<br />
2. Zero-Trust model<br />
3. Encryption and hashing<br />
4. Basic compliance concepts

**1. Shared responsibilty and defence in-depth<br />**
  i. On-premises datacenters: Customer is responsible for everything from       physical security to encrypting sensitive data. <br />
  
 ii. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Cloud provider is responsible for physical components like computers, network and physical security of the datacenter. Cloud cutomer is responsible for software components such as OS, network controls, applications and protecting data.

 iii. Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS provides environment for building,testing and deploying software apps.Cloud provider manages hardware and OS while customer is responsible for apps and data.

iv. Software as a Service (SaaS): example is M365, Skype via a subscription. Cloud provider manages everything except data, devices, accounts and identities

In all cloud model, customer is always responsible for:

  Information and data
  Devices (mobile and PCs)
  Accounts and identities

**Defense in depth**<br />: It uses a layered approach to security rather than relying on ansingle perimeter. It uses a series of mechanism/layer to slow advance of an attack so when one layer is breached, a subsequent layer will prevent an attacker getting unauthorized access to data.<br />
The layers might be; Physical, Identity and access, Perimeter, Network, Compute, Application and Data.

**Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)**

Confidentiality: Refers to the need to keep sensitive data, keys, passwords and other secrets confidential.<br />
Integrity: Refers to keeping data or messages correct. When you send email messages, you want to be sure recipient got the same messages you sent. <br />
Availability: Refers to making data available to those who need it , when they need it.

**Zero Trust model**<br />: The principle that nothing is secure even resources behind the firewalls.
